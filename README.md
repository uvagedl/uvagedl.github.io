## UvA - An Introduction to Group Equivariant Deep Learning

Welcome to the public page for the mini-course on Group Equivariant Deep Learning. The course is currently still a work in progress, so please forgive me for the occasional sloppyness in the provided materials. In the upcoming months I will regularly update them. The most important piece of material in this course are the lecture notes.
